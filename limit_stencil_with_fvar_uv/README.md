# Notes

I am learning about limit stencil with fvar UV, it was recommended to me to have a look at example 1_3


## Uncertainties

* My initial learning about EvaluateStencil is based on bfr_tutorial_1_5 which works with Control Points
* bfr_tutorial_1_3 does not make any call to EvaluateStencil
* bfr_tutorial_1_3 works on Patch Points rather than Control Point, I don't know if I should just use the Patch Point or redo all the Control Point work as per 1_5, i.e. does it make sense to call EvaluateStencil with patch points in the first place
